             * Vector rotation by transformation matrix: r is the original vector, r_T is the rotated vector,
             * and phi is the angle of rotation. Based on the solution approach by Jens Geisler.
             *     r_T = [cos(phi) -sin(phi);
             *            sin(phi)  cos(phi)] * r ;
             *
             * For arc generation, the center of the circle is the axis of rotation and the radius vector is
             * defined from the circle center to the initial position. Each line segment is formed by successive
             * vector rotations. This requires only two cos() and sin() computations to form the rotation
             * matrix for the duration of the entire arc. Error may accumulate from numerical round-off, since
             * all double numbers are single precision on the Arduino. (True double precision will not have
             * round off issues for CNC applications.) Single precision error can accumulate to be greater than
             * tool precision in some cases. Therefore, arc path correction is implemented.
             *
             * Small angle approximation may be used to reduce computation overhead further. This approximation
             * holds for everything, but very small circles and large MM_PER_ARC_SEGMENT values. In other words,
             * theta_per_segment would need to be greater than 0.1 rad and N_ARC_CORRECTION would need to be large
             * to cause an appreciable drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION~=25 is more than small enough to correct for
             * numerical drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION may be on the order a hundred(s) before error becomes an
             * issue for CNC machines with the single precision Arduino calculations.
             *
             * This approximation also allows plan_arc to immediately insert a line segment into the planner
             * without the initial overhead of computing cos() or sin(). By the time the arc needs to be applied
             * a correction, the planner should have caught up to the lag caused by the initial plan_arc overhead.
             * This is important when there are successive arc motions.
